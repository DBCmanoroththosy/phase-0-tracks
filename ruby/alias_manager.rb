#pseudocode and write a method that takes a spy's real name (e.g., "Felicia Torres") and creates a fake name with it by doing the following:

# Swapping the first and last name.
# Changing all of the vowels (a, e, i, o, or u) to the next vowel in 'aeiou', and all of the consonants (everything else besides the vowels) to the next consonant in the alphabet. So 'a' would become 'e', 'u' would become 'a', and 'd' would become 'f'.
# If you get really and truly stuck, just write an alias method that loops through the original name and changes the letters somehow, without worrying about implementing this particular algorithm.
